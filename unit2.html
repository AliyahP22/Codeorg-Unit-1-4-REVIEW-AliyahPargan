      <h1>Lesson#1 C.F.U</h1>
      <p>How do you use the Internet? Think about your typical day. When are you using the Internet? For what purposes? What role does it have in your life?</p>
      <p>You can use the internet to look up stuff and do research. You also use the internet to talk to people. The internet has a very important role in peoples lives because people use it in their everyday lives and sometimes they even do it absent-mindily, meaning they use it so often, they don't think much of it.</p>

      <h1>Lesson#2 C.F.U</h1>
      <p>Describe two different paths that a message could take from Person A to Person D.</p>
      <p>In order to balance all 3 guidelines, a way that you can get a message from Person A to Person D is from Person A then to Person B then to Person D. It would get to D and also go to c. Another way you can get a message from person a to do is from person a to person e to person c to person D. You need to make sure it is guaranteed it would get to person D so by someone holding 2 strings, there is more of a likely chance that person D could get the message.</p>
