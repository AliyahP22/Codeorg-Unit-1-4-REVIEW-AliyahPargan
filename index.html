      <b>Unit 1</b>
      <hr>
     <p>In unit 1 of web and app development, we were introduced to so many new concepts, which would soon be important to know later. The first thing we learned was the basics of HTML. HTML is the basic structure of the website.  We learned about the basic tags such as p for paragraph,h1-h6 which are heading paragraphs, and the body tag. We even learned how to add a link to a webpage using ‚Äúa href‚Äù. Next, we learned how to represent information and we learned about binary numbers. Binary numbers is a number system with 2 shapes, and we also got a better understanding of bits and bytes. One of the main things that we learned in this unit is the concept of RBG and the layers of abstraction in digital images.. R stands for red, G for green, and B for blue and the main idea was to make different colors with just 3 bits. RGB became important for the final lessons and the next unit following. We were introduced to the topic of CSS. CSS stands for cascading style sheets and it is all about adding creativity and design to a website/webpage using code. </p>

       <p>Next, we began unit 2. Unit 2 was all about the internet! To start off this unit, we first had to ask ourselves ‚Äúwhat is the internet‚Äù. The internet is a system used worldwide where people of multiple networks can access information at the same time as other users from other networks. We even learned about the history of the internet and who created it and for its purpose. To gain a better understanding, we tested an internet simulator on the first lesson on a website called Code.Org. We began to learn about different concepts that make the internet work the way we know it. For example, we learned about routers, computing networks, a path, and bandwidth. Throughout our normal lessons, we were able to explore more in depth about computers sending and receiving information using simulators on code.org. We even learned about IP addresses. The main takeaway from this unit was the idea of using packets to send a large amount of data. We learned about 2 different protocols, which were User Datagram protocol (UDP) and Transmission Control protocol (TCP). UPD sends information quickly without worrying about accuracy and TCP is slower but is more accurate compared to UDP. We ended the unit learning about DNS and HTTP and doing a research project about internet dilemmas. My project was about the digital divide, which was the internet limitations between certain groups of people and people residing in certain regions and how the dilemma affects their lives. </p>

          <b>Unit 3</b>
          <hr>
         <p>Unit 3 was an introduction to app design and development. The last 2 units were about websites and webpages, so app development was a completely new concept. However, it involved using the knowledge of code from the previous units. To gain an idea of what we would be doing for the unit, we started exploring different apps and taking notes on how it works. After getting an idea, we began learning how to design an app on code.org, which taught us about the important concepts known as user interface, input and output. User interface is the interaction between humans and devices and forms of software such as buttons, menus and images. Input is the data put into a computer for processing and the output is the information that is displayed on the screen after. Using this knowledge, we designed the screens for an app we were creating with a partner. Then we learned about how to code this app using 2 different types of programs, which were sequential programming and event driven programming. Sequential programming involves no user interaction as the code runs from top to bottom. However, event driven programming is the opposite, as programs run differently depending on user interaction. After programming the app with our partner, we learned about debugging, which is basically going back and reviewing your code and fixing any errors. </p>

            <hr>
           <p>The last unit we have learned about so far is about variables, conditionals, and functions. A variable is a container in programming used for storing data. Since in this unit, we are focusing on javaScript, we also began the unit learning about new concepts. A string is a data type used that represents a number of character values. To understand variables better, we investigated with a thermostat app and identified how they used variables in their code. One of the main and most important things to know about variables is to define a variable (var) only once, otherwise it would cause errors. We also learned about the types of variables (global and local). To further our knowledge,we started using var with a program called ‚ÄúGhost School‚Äù. Ghost school used pseudocode, which was fake code in the similar style as javaScript to help us understand how to use var, boolean expressions, and just all in all understand javaScript programming better. We were introduced to algorithms, parameters, and elements. In code, an element is one of the items stored in a list. After some time studying variables, we started studying about booleans and how to evaluate them. A boolean can result in two states: true or false. They can be evaluated using truth tables and symbols like || (or), &&(And), ==(equals/get). and != (not equal). These specific symbols are known as comparison operators. Next, we learned about conditional statements (if-else if statements) and how to program conditional statements successfully. Lastly, we learned how to declare and call functions. A specific function that was used a lot throughout the unit was the updateScreen function. Once we fully understood all these concepts, we put all these together and practiced coding apps, and soon we designed our own decision making app and then programming it to result in 3 different outcomes. My app was about what jewelry style is your ideal style, which had 4 different outcomes for the user due to the conditional statements used in the code. The user was allowed to interact with the dropdown menus due to the onEvents.
