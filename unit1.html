    <h1>Lesson#1 C.F.U</h1>
      <b>What are your own strategies and insights about how to learn best? And, how are they similar or different to the ones that you just heard about from other students?</b>
      <p>Some strategies of mine that help me learn in the best way possible is by taking notes while in class and gaining the information that I possibly missed from a friend. Then I would try my best to make some free time between doing other homework and classwork and try to study for that class. In addition, I would also try to do more research on what we're learning and find more resources if confused. Comparing to the other students strategies, mines are similar to theirs because they both suggest the idea of taking notes and studying/testing myself. </p>

      <h1>Lesson#2 C.F.U</h1>
      <b>Why did we decide to send a message as a sequence of two options rather than modifying our devices to represent more options?</b>
      <p>We decided to send a message as a sequence of 2 instead of representing more options so it would be easier for the user to understand and use. It also demonstrates how the user controls the device, which is why it is better to make it more simple over a overcomplicated device.</p>

      <h1>Lesson#3 C.F.U</h1>
      <p>How would you explain a number system to someone who had never seen numbers before?</p>
      <p>A number system is a pattern that consists of 10 numbers (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9). It is a way to express these numbers and there is many ways to express numbers and number patterns. You can even double them using exponents. For example, 2^2 = 4 and 4^2 = 8.</p>

      <p>The 8-bit system will be able to represent sixteen times as many values as the 4-bit system.Each time we add another bit, the amount of numbers we can make increases and doubles.</p>

      <h1>Lesson#5 C.F.U</h1>
      <b>Modern car odometers can record up to a million miles driven. What happens to the odometer reading when a car drives beyond its maximum reading? When using bits to represent fractions of a number, can you create all possible fractions? Why or why not?</b>
      <p>When a car drives beyond it's maximum reading, the odometer would roll to 0 and start over, just like when the chart reaches it's overflow level. When using bits to represent fractions, it is not possible to create all possible fractions because some numbers cannot be represented through a fraction. For example, some numbers may be too large.</p>

        <b>"The binary pattern 01000001 represents the number 65."
        Write a brief response explaining whether you believe this statement is always true. Explain your reasoning.</b>
      <p>I think this statement is not always true because the binary pattern on the ASCII chart creates A but on the the flippity do, it creates the value 65. This shows that even though every binary pattern is unique, it can result in different products</p>

          <b>Describe how the process of sampling, RGB pixels, and binary sequences work together to display a digital color image.</b>
      <p>The process of sampling, RGB, and binary all work together by letting the computer know what color and what binary sequence would be placed in what spot</p>

      <h1>Lesson#9 C.F.U</h1>
        <b>What is the most important quality of lossless compression?</b>
      <p> A.   The data is transformed to usually make it smaller. It can always be re-constructed back to the original.</p>
        <b>The file on their computer is 1000 bytes. When they attach the file to their email, it shows as 750 bytes. The author gets very upset because they are concerned that part of their book has been deleted by the email provider.If you could talk to this author, how would you explain what is happening to their book?</b>
        <p>I would explain that their book is just simply being compressed, which means the number of bits reduced to make it easier to produce. In other words, no part of the book got deleted, but instead, some words just simply turned into symbols or abbreviations.</p>

      <p>Lossy compression should be applied to text messages and music while images and videos should be applied to lossless compression.</p>

      <p>It allows your work to be shared, reused, and remixed to help spark more creativity.</p>
          <b>Now that we understand Copyright, what would need to change in order for the scenario from the warm-up to be okay?

          <p>In order for it to be ok for the person to reuse your image, they got to give you credit, as your the one who originally owns the image. </p>
