      <h1>Lesson#5 C.F.U</h1>
      <p>What is the difference between a sequential program and an event-driven program?</p>
      <p>The difference between a sequential program and an event-driven program is with an event-driven program, the user can interact with the program in order for it to work. For example, with the onEvent code, we were able to choose click and when we ran our program, we had to click to make certain functions work. However, with a sequential program, when you press run, it would automatically start working on its own using the code given.</p>
